# Compiler Construction Projects

This repository showcases various programs developed as part of my **Compiler Construction** course in the 8th semester. These programs implement core concepts of compiler design, including file handling, lexical analysis, grammar processing, and parser construction.

## Programs Overview

1. **File Handling**  
   - Implements basic file read and write operations in C.

2. **Comment Removal**  
   - Removes single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments from a given file.

3. **Keyword Detection and Comment Removal**  
   - Detects and counts special keywords in a file while removing comment lines.

4. **Regular Expression Matching**  
   - Matches input strings against a given regular expression pattern.

5. **Unique Identifier and Variable Detection**  
   - Identifies and counts unique identifiers and variables in a given file.

6. **Left Recursion Elimination**  
   - Removes left recursion from a given grammar production.

7. **Left Recursion and Left Factoring**  
   - Eliminates left recursion and checks for left factoring in context-free grammar.

8. **First Sets Calculation**  
   - Computes the First sets for grammar non-terminals using recursive methods.

9. **Follow Sets Calculation**  
   - Determines the Follow sets for grammar non-terminals to assist in parser construction.
